# Three Method to judge whether a list has cycle

## 1. Using Two Pointers  

Two pointers, one is pSlow, the other is pFast.  
The pSlow moves 1 step, the pFast moves 2 steps(if pFast->next is nullptr, then pFast = nullptr).  
When pSlow is equal to pFast, there is cycle in list.  
If pFast is nullptr, there is no cycle in list.  
Animation:  
When there is no cycle in list:

When there has cycle in list:

Prove: **pFast will meet pSlow**  
pFast is fater than pSlow, pFast will meet pSlow finally.  

let $v(pSlow)$ = step(s) that pSlow go per loop  
then  $v(pFast) = kt$  

let $D$ = when pSlow enter cycle, how long have pFast gone from the enterance  

Let $d(pFast)$ = when pFast meets pSlow, how long have pFast gone  
Let $R$ = size of cycle  

$S + d(pFast) - d(pSlow) = nR$  
$(S + (k-1)t = nR)$

Performance:  
Time: $O(n)$  
Space: $O(1)$  

## 2. Using Hashmap

Time: $O(n)$  
Space: $O(n)$  

## 3. By Redirecting the node->next to Self

Time: $O(n)$  
Space: $O(1)$
